QWiimote implements access to a Wiimote following the Qt object model. Instead of using the Wiimote as a gaming device or a mouse, QWiimoteâ€™s goal is knowing the orientation of the device after smooth movements as precisely as possible. The project uses Qt 4.7.2 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2010. QWiimote implements asynchronous reading of Wiimote reports and usage of signals to notify state changes. It also implements [Exponential Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Exponential_moving_average) as an acceleration smoothing method to achieve greater positioning precision.
